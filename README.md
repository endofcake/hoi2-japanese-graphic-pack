#Japanese Graphic Pack / Japanese Graphic Pack Extended (JGP/JGPE)

The primary aim of this graphic pack is to provide a player with refurbished or totally new Japanese unit models. In the process of searching for correct photos of some units I had to do certain changes to vanilla model roster, sometimes quite extensive. Usually I added additional models, but sometimes I had to delete some weird ones. The changes do not alter game balance in any way, they just add some gloss to this already great game. By no means I claim that a Japanese model of given level is equivalent to its American, German or Soviet counterpart; I was guided more by the date of entrance to service than by technical characteristics.

JGP is very easy to use — just copy the folders to your HoI2 DDA folder (as always, it would be wise to make a backup of clean HoI2 installation). 

Enjoy!

JGPE adds several dozens of models, brigades, tech teams and a couple of leaders. I'm too lazy to count actually:)

Version 0.6 of JGP (aka Japanese Leaders and Ministers):

-165 new photos of Japanese leaders (both generals and admirals)
-69 photos of Japanese ministers (mostly pre-1947)
I think I can call it _the definite overhaul of Japanese leaders pics_. Some can probably be added, but I've worked really hard to find new and better photos of every Japanese leader in the database.

Changes made to leaders and ministers files:
- Kusgibichi renamed to Kushibuchi
- Kanichiro renamed Tashiro Kanichiro
- Kilitsin corrected to Kislitsin
- Nishi Takeichi - deathdate moved from 1940 to 1945 (historically correct)
- Nomura Kichisaburo - correct photograph used
- added several images for Tojo (minister)

If you don't want these corrections to be made in your copy of HoI, just do not copy db folder. Images will work fine without it.

JGPE adds:
- 53 leaders
- 36 ministers
- PSD templates for easy modding

Version 0.5 of JGP:
-3 new brigades (MP and Engineers)
-47 new models: full coverage of Infantry (8 models), Marines (6 models), Mountain (6 models), Militia (3 models), Garrison (4 models), HQ (4 models), Motorized infantry (5 models) and Mechanized infantry (6 models), plus 5 models for Cavalry (without Air Cavalry'51)
-5 new combat events (battle, ambush, breakthrough, counterattack and encirclement)
-3 new propaganda posters for Australia, Manchukuo and the USA

JGPE contains:
-60 additional models (some of them colour) of ground troops
-7 extra ENG and MP brigades
-1 extra propaganda poster

=================

Version 0.4 of JGP:

New models for capitals ships:
CV — 7 new models:
-introduced Hosho, Kaga (<Soryu), swapped Shinano with Taiho, moved Shinano one step later (from Advanced Heavy Carrier to Advanced Super-Heavy Carrier, Taiho is Semi-Modern now)
CVL — 5 new models:
-removed Hosho, introduced Ryujo, Taiyo, Hiyo and Unryu
BB — 8 new models:
-introdused Ise, removed Kii (never built, so no pictures of it), plus 4 pictures for intermediate models
BC — 4 new models:
-added Ibuki, deleted Amagi, No13 and B-64. All models except lvl 0 Ibuki are photos of Kongo-class battleships (yes, BB) of different years.
CA — 7 new models:
-added Aoba, Myoko (instead of Nachi), Takao, Mogami (it's CL in vanilla), Tone and Ibuki (used Mogami photo for that one, as Ibuki was only a project supposed to look somewhat like Mogami)

New leaders and minister photos:
-31 naval and airforce commanders, usually the most skilled ones
-4 ministers (the work has just begun)

New propaganda posters:
-12 posters for Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Russia, Spain (both), UK, Ukraine and Vichy France

Interface changes: replaced default land battle image — a German soldier — with Japanese one. More work to be done here yet.

JGPE contains:
-15 extra capital ships models (some colour)
-9 leaders and 3 minister photos
-1 extra propaganda poster

=================

Version 0.3 of JGP includes:
4 new models for STR
7 new models for TAC
5 new models for TRA
new propaganda poster for Germany (not sure if I'll leave in future versions)

Following changes are made:
-brigades should now have correct names
-changed model for last NAV
-changed propaganda poster for Japan, deleted the poster for Manchukuo (can be found in JGPE)

In models roster:
STR
inserted Kawasaki Ki-91 (CG, as there are no photos of it) before Nakajima G10N1 Fugaku

TRA
swapped Mitsubishi Ki-57 (introduced earlier) with Yokosuka L3Y, inserted Showa L2D before Yokosuka L3Y. It's stretching the historical truth, of course, but no more then using Kawasaki C-1 and Shin Meiwa PS-1.

JGPE has some coloured models for Japanese late-game units.
